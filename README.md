# crashdump

A small utility for converting macOS crashreport files (.ips) into text output which is the same as
what you would see using Console.app to open them.

Works with macOS 12 (Monterey) and macOS 13 (Ventura) as of 2022-11-06. Uses private APIs so no
guarantees moving forward.

The crash reports generated by the system can usually be found in 
`~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports`.
